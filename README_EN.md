## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design work?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute.
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, suffering from severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Asset quality is low and lacks relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Refer to AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting methods—**Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**—to cater to different creative workflows.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Simply input a topic, and the AI will automatically generate a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via "Vibe" commands (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with the AI responding and adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Modes**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual refinement of details.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF/Docx/MD/Txt files, and the system automatically parses the content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information from the text, providing rich materials for generation.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize PPT styles.

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menu buttons; issue modification commands directly via **natural language**.
- **Partial Redraw**: Make verbal-style modifications to specific areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition pages with a consistent style based on nano banana pro🍌.

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio; layout requires no manual adjustment, ready for direct presentation.

### 5. Fully Editable PPTX Export (Beta)

- **Export images as high-fidelity, clean-background PPT pages with freely editable images and text**
- For related updates, see https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121
- **If the editable PPT results are suboptimal (e.g., text overlapping, unstyled text), it is usually caused by configuration issues. Please refer to [Common Issues and Troubleshooting for Editable PPTX Export](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121#issuecomment-3708872527) for troubleshooting.**

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support increasing the resolution; Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Does it support free-tier Gemini API Keys?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 Error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands provided in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is generally caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key not taking effect after setting it in .env?**
    - After editing `.env` during runtime, you must restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If you have configured parameters in the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can restore the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings."

1. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create the `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables:
> **The Large Language Model (LLM) interfaces in this project follow the AIHubMix platform format. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain API keys to reduce migration costs.**<br>
> **Friendly Reminder: The interface costs for the Google nano banana pro model are relatively high; please be mindful of usage costs.**

<details>
  <summary>📒 Using Vertex AI (GCP Free Tier)</summary>

If you want to use Google Cloud Vertex AI (GCP new user credits can be used), additional configuration is required:

1. Create a service account in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and download the JSON key file
2. Rename the key file to `gcp-service-account.json` and place it in the project root directory
3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the following:
   ```yaml
   # environment:
   #   - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/gcp-service-account.json
   # ...
   # - ./gcp-service-account.json:/app/gcp-service-account.json:ro
   ```

> **Note**: The `gemini-3-*` series models require setting `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synchronized with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip the local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Launch with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from source**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following lines in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```
